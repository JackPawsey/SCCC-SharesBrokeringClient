# SharesBrokeringClient

This client stores a record of user owned shares and user money in .TXT files at the clientâ€™s location

The contents of these files are used to determine whether a client can make a buy or sell transaction

The client connects to the SharesBrokeringService to buy/sell shares and to the RESTStockService to retreive share prices and volume
